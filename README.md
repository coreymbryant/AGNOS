AGNoS: Adaptive Goal-oriented Non-intrusive Surrogates

(Agnostos is the greek word for unknown. One could alternatively say AGNoStoS: Adaptive Goal-oreinted Non-intrusive Stochastic Surrogates, but AGNoS is much easier to write)


This software supports non-intrusive construction of surrogate models for uncertainty propagation. Adaptive construction is based on the defintion of specific goal functionals or quantities of interest.
